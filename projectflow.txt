1. Create Git Repo and clone it in local.
2. Create a file 'code.py' and add code to it. It will save a csv file to a new 'data' folder.
3. Do a Git add-commit-push before intialising DVC.
#pip install DVC
4. Now we do "dvc init". (Creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir S3". (Creates a new S3 Directory)
6. Now do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3".
7. Next "dvc add data/".
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
10. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
11. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
12. Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
13. Then git add-commit-push (we're saving V2 of our data at this point)
14. Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date.
15. Now repeat step 11-13 for v3 of data.
